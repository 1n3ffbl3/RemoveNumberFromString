These files contain step-by-step descriptions of how JS executes your solution on 2+ specific inputs.  You will complete them by pasting your solution into [this site](http://www.pythontutor.com/javascript.html#mode=edit) and keeping track of what happens with each execution step.  The goal is to be able to step through the code in your head the same way JavaScript does.  

You'll know you've made it when you can predict what pythontutor will do before you click "next".


You can look through the [demo](https://github.com/elewa-student/String-Reverser/tree/master/step-throughs) to see a finished example.
